# Fall 2024 Final, Robotic Arm
## Introduction
This project showcases the creation and use of a 3D printed arm that operates through a Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller. The robotic arm is designed to be affordable and adaptable, for purposes in the fields of automation and robotics. The control unit for the arm is the Raspberry Pi Pico running MicroPython to handle movement commands and user interactions. By testing versions and refining the design gradually the project showcases how incorporating printing and built in technology can result in a working robotic arm.
